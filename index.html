        <p>The name of this project is "elibrārium" which is a word constructed from the English adjective "electronic" and the Latin noun "librārium", meaning bookcase or library. Putting those two toghether should be sufficient to describe the purpose of the project – which is essentially to produce an electronic library and book reader. More specifically an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">EPUB</a> library manager and book reader built on top of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/platform/">Eclipse Platform</a>.</p>

<p><em>A showcase of the various features that are already in place</em></p>

<p>Please note that this project is in it's early stages. So while there is a working EPUB reader – it has not yet reached release quality. However please take it for a test drive and if you feel inclined -- lend a hand to make it better.</p>

<h3>Supported platforms</h3>

<p>The reader is relying on the WebKit HTML rendering engine so this must be present on the host system. On OS X and i.e. Ubuntu 10.04 this is already the case. On Windows; Safari must be installed. Also note that Eclipse version 3.7 or newer is required.</p>
