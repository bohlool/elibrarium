{"name":"Elibrarium","body":"The name of this project is \"elibrārium\" which is a word constructed from the English adjective \"electronic\" and the Latin noun \"librārium\", meaning bookcase or library. Putting those two toghether should be sufficient to describe the purpose of the project – which is essentially to produce an electronic library and book reader. More specifically an [EPUB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) library manager and book reader built on top of the [Eclipse Platform](http://www.eclipse.org/platform/).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/turesheim/elibrarium/wiki/collage.png\" align=\"center\"/>\r\n\r\n*A showcase of the various features that are already in place*\r\n\r\nPlease note that this project is in it's early stages. So while there is a working EPUB reader – it has not yet reached release quality. However please take it for a test drive and if you feel inclined -- lend a hand to make it better.\r\n\r\n### Supported platforms\r\n\r\nThe reader is relying on the WebKit HTML rendering engine so this must be present on the host system. On OS X and i.e. Ubuntu 10.04 this is already the case. On Windows; Safari must be installed. Also note that Eclipse version 3.7 or newer is required.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><th>Platform</th><th>Requirements</th></tr>\r\n<tr><td>Mac OS X 10.7</td><td>None in particular</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>Windows 7</td><td>32-bit SWT, Safari must be installed</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>Linux</td><td>WebKitGTK 1.2.0 or newer</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe [planned set of features](elibrarium/wiki/Plan) are basically those you expect to find in any modern reading system, such as book-like navigation, table of contents, search, bookmarks along with support for adding notes and marking text.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThis software is released under the [Eclipse Public License 1.0](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).\r\n\r\n### Copyright\r\nCopyright (c) 2011,2012 Torkild Ulvøy Resheim, All Rights Reserved.","tagline":"Desktop EPUB reader and book manager built on Eclipse.","google":"UA-385358-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
