#Elibrarium

The name of this project is "elibrarium" which is a word constructed from the
English adjective "electronic" and the Latin noun "librārium", meaning bookcase
or library. Putting those two toghether should be sufficient to describe the 
purpose of the project, which is essentially to produce an electronic library
and book reader.
