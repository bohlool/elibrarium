#Elibrarium
The name of this project is "elibrārium" which is a word constructed from the English adjective "electronic" and the Latin noun "librārium", meaning bookcase or library. Putting those two toghether should be sufficient to describe the purpose of the project – which is essentially to produce an electronic library and book reader. More specifically an [EPUB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) library manager and book reader built on top of the [Eclipse Platform](http://www.eclipse.org/platform/). While EPUB is initially supported it will be possible to leverage the project's API to add support for other electronic book formats. Since the software is built on top of Eclipse it can also execute on all the popular operating systems such as Linux, Windows and OS X.

##Features
The planned set of features are basically those you expect to find in any modern reading system, such as book-like navigation, table of contents, search, bookmarks ans support for adding notes and marking text.
